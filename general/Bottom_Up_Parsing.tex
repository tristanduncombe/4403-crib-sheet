\subsection{Bottom Up Parsing}

\subsubsection{Shift/Reduce Parsing}
Makes use of a parse stack and has three actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{shift} - push the next input symbol onto the stack,
    \item \textbf{reduce} - if a sequence of symbols on the top of the stack, $\alpha$, 
    matches the right side of some production $N \rightarrow \alpha$, then the sequence 
    $\alpha$ on top of the stack is replaced by $N$.
    \item \textbf{accept} - if the stack contains just the start symbol and there is no
    input left, the input has been recognised and is accepted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{LR(0) Grammars}
An LR(0) parsing item is of the form
\begin{align*}
    N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet \beta
\end{align*}
which indicates that, in matching $N$, $\alpha$ has been matched and $\beta$ is yet to 
be matched where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$ is a nonterminal symbol,
    \item $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are possibly empty sequences of (terminal and nonterminal) 
    symbols such that $N \rightarrow \alpha\ \beta$ is a production of the grammer, and
    \item $\bullet$ marks the current position in matching the right side.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsubsection{Parsing Automaton}
An LR(0) parsing automaton consists of
\begin{itemize}
    \item a finite set of states, each of which consists of a set of LR(0) parsing items, and
    \item transitions between states, each of which is labelled by a transition symbol.
\end{itemize}
Each state in an LR(0) parsing automaton must have only one associated parsing action.

\subsubsubsubsection{Automaton States}
If a state has an LR(0) item of the form
\begin{align*}
    N &\rightarrow \alpha \bullet M \beta \\
\end{align*}
where the nonterminal $M$ has productions
\begin{align*}
    M &\rightarrow \alpha_1 \\
    M &\rightarrow \alpha_2 \\
    &\vdots \\
    M &\rightarrow \alpha_m \\
\end{align*}
then the state also includes the derived items
\begin{align*}
    M &\rightarrow \bullet \alpha_1 \\
    M &\rightarrow \bullet \alpha_2 \\
    &\vdots \\
    M &\rightarrow \bullet \alpha_m
\end{align*}

\subsubsubsubsection{Goto States}
If a state $s_i$ has an LR(0) item of the form
\begin{align*}
    N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet x \beta
\end{align*}
where $x$ is either a terminal symbol or a nonterminal symbol, then there is a goto state, 
$s_j$, from the state $s_1$ on $x$, and $s_j$ includes a kernel item of the form
\begin{align*}
    N \rightarrow \alpha x \bullet \beta
\end{align*}
If there are multiple items in $s_i$ with the same $x$ immediately to the right of the 
$\bullet$ then the goto state $s_j$ includes all those items but with the $\bullet$ after 
that occurence of $x$ rather than before it.

\subsubsubsubsection{Actions}
An LR(0) item of the form
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet a \beta$ where $a$ is a terminal symbol, indicates 
    the state containing the item has a shift  \textbf{parsing} action
    \item $S' \rightarrow S \bullet$ where $S'$ is the (introduced) start symbol for the 
    grammer, inidcates the state containing the item has an  \textbf{accept} action
    \item $N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet$ where $N$ is not the (introduced) start symbol for 
    the grammar, indicates the state containing the item has a parsing action 
    \textbf{reduce $N \rightarrow \alpha$}
\end{itemize}
A shift action at end-of-file is an error, as is an accept action when the input is not at 
end-of-file.

        \$0(2A4)5 & \$ & reduce \( A \rightarrow (A)\) \\
        \$0A1 & \$ & accept \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsubsubsubsection{Parsing Conflicts}
If a state in an LR(0) parsing automaton has more than one action, 
there is a parsing action conflict.

A grammar is LR(0) if none of the states in its LR(0) parsing 
automaton contains a parsing action conflict.

\subsubsubsection{LR(1) Grammars}
An LR(1) parsing item is a pair
\begin{align*}
    [N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet \beta, T]
\end{align*}
consisting of
\begin{itemize}
    \item an LR(0) parsing item $N \rightarrow a \bullet \beta$, and
    \item a set $T$ of terminal symbols called a look-ahead set.
\end{itemize}
The above item indicates that in matchin $N$, $\alpha$ has been matched and $\beta$ is yet 
to be matched, in a context in which $N$ can be followed by a terminal symbol in the set $T$.

\subsubsubsubsection{Parsing Automaton}
The kernal item of the initial state is
\begin{align*}
    [S' \rightarrow \bullet S, \$]
\end{align*}
where $S$ is the start symbol of the grammar and we introduce a fresh replacement start 
symbol $S'$ and production $S' \rightarrow S$. This fresh production is used to determine 
when parsing has completed.

\subsubsubsubsection{Derived Items}
If a state has an LR(1) item of the form
\begin{align*}
    [N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet M \beta, T]
\end{align*}
where the nonterminal M has productions
\begin{align*}
    M \rightarrow \alpha_1 | \alpha_2 | \dots | \alpha_m
\end{align*}
and $T = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, then the state also includes the derived items
\begin{align*}
    [N \rightarrow \bullet \alpha_1, T]
    \dots
    [N \rightarrow \bullet \alpha_m, T]
\end{align*}
where if $\beta$ is not nullable $T' = First(\beta)$ and if $\beta$ is nullable, 
$T' = First(\beta) - \{\epsilon\} \cup T$.

\subsubsubsubsection{Parsing Actions}
An LR(1) item of the form
\begin{itemize}
    \item $[N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet a \beta, T]$, where $a$ is a terminal symbol, 
    indicates the state containing the item has a \textbf{shift} parsion action if the
    next input $x$ is $a$
    \item $[S' \rightarrow \S \bullet, \$]$, where $S'$ is the added start symbol for 
    the grammar, indicates the state containing the item has an \textbf{accept} action 
    if there is no more input.
    \item $[N \rightarrow \alpha \bullet, T]$, where $N$ is not $S'$, indicates the state 
    containing the item has a parsing action \textbf{reduce $N \rightarrow \alpha$} if 
    the next input $x$ is in $T$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsubsection{Example}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}[c]
        S \rightarrow E
    \end{aligned}
    \qquad 
    \begin{aligned}[c]
        E \rightarrow E + n
    \end{aligned}
    \qquad 
    \begin{aligned}[c]
        E \rightarrow n
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsubsubsection{Parsing Action Conflicts}
If a state in an LR(1) parsing automaton has more than one action for a look-ahead 
terminal symbol, there is a parsing action conflict.

A grammar is LR(1) if none of the states in its LR(1) parsing automaton contains a parsing
action conflict.


\subsubsubsection{LALR(1) Parsing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Look-Ahead merged LR(1) parsing where each state of an LALR(1) parsing automaton 
    consists of a set of LR(1) items.
    \item An LALR(1) parsing automaton can be formed from an LR(1) parsing automaton by 
    merging states that have identical sets of LR(0) items but possibly different look-ahead 
    sets.
    \item Each item in the merged state consists of one of the LR(0) items in the states 
    being merged with a look-ahead set that is the union of the look-ahead sets of that item 
    in all the states being merged.
    \item The parsing actions for LALR(1) parsing are defined in the same way as for LR(1) 
    parsing.
    \item A grammar is LALR(1) if none of the states in its LALR(1) parsing automaton contains 
    a parsing action conflict.
\end{itemize}
