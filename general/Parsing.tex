\subsubsubsection{Left and right associative operators}
To remove the ambiguit and treat \emph{"-"} as  a left associate operator (as usual) we can rewrite the grammar to

$E \rightarrow E - T$ \\
$E \rightarrow T$ \\
$T \rightarrow N$ \\
and to treat \emph{"-"} as right associative we use
$E \rightarrow T - E$ \\
$E \rightarrow T$ \\
$T \rightarrow N$ \\
