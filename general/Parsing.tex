\subsection{Parsing Theory}

\subsubsection{Context Free Grammars}
A context-free grammar consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item A finite set, $\sum$,  of terminal symbols.
\item A finite nonempty set of nonterminal symbols (disjoint from the terminal symbols).
\item A finite nonempty set of producions of the form of $A \rightarrow \alpha$, where $A$ is a nonterminal symbol, and $\alpha$ is a possibly empty sequence of symbols, each of which is either a terminal of nonterminal symbol.
\item A start symbol that must be a nonterminal symbol
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Nullable}
A possibly empty sequence of symbols, $\alpha$, is nullable if  $\alpha \stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} \epsilon$ or $\alpha \stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow}$
Nullable rules
\begin{itemize}
        \item $\epsilon$ is nullable
        \item any terminal symbol is not nullable
        \item a sequence of symbols is nullable if all of its constructs are nullable
        \item a set of alternatives is nullable if any of its constructs are nullable
        \item EBNF constructs for optionals and repetitions are nullable
        \item a nonterminal is nullable if there is a production with a nullable right-hand side
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Left and right associative operators}
To remove the ambiguit and treat \emph{"-"} as  a left associate operator (as usual) we can rewrite the grammar to

$E \rightarrow E - T$ \\
$E \rightarrow T$ \\
$T \rightarrow N$ \\
and to treat \emph{"-"} as right associative we use
$E \rightarrow T - E$ \\
$E \rightarrow T$ \\
$T \rightarrow N$ \\

\subsubsubsection{Dangling Else}
Dangling else is a problem that arises when we have an if-then-else statement and the else is ambiguous as to which if it belongs to.
