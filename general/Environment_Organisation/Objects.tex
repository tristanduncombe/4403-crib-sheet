\subsubsection{Objects}
Each field in an object is at a fixed offset from the start of 
every instance in the heap.

\subsubsubsection{Subclassing}
Aditional fields follow the inherited fields \& have fixed 
offsets from the start. Fields that are redeclared replace the 
previously declared field at the same offset.

\subsubsubsubsection{Dynamic Dispatch Table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item it has an entry for every method of the class (including inherited 
    methods)
    \item the entry gives the address of the code for the method
    \item the entries are at a fixed offset from the start of the dynamic 
    dispatch table
    \item the entries for inherited \& overridden methods are at the same 
    offsets as in the superclass
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsubsection{This}
\textbf{this} is passed as an additional implicit parameter to each method.

\subsubsubsubsection{Static Fields \& Methods}
Static fields \& methods are resolved statically (at compile time). Static
methods are not called on an object \& hence they do not have an object 
reference as an implicit this parameter.
